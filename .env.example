# .env.example - Environment Override Examples
# Copy this to .env for local development
# Only include values you want to override from the defaults in config.py

# For local development, you usually don't need to override anything!
# The defaults in config.py should work fine.

# Uncomment only if you need different values for local testing:

# ENVIRONMENT=development
# CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001,http://localhost:5173
# MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10

# For production deployment, set these in your deployment platform (e.g., Render):
# ENVIRONMENT=production  
# CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com
